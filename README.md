# diamond_price_prediction
Predict the diamond size using KNN from scratch on the given dataset.
Task - Predict the diamond price.
Write the KNN code from scratch and make it work on the given dataset ?

Step - 1: Load the data
Step - 2: Perform the EDA on the given dataset
Step - 3: Handle Categorical Columns i.e. convert them to numerical representation.
Step - 4: Normalize the data
Step - 5: Split the data - Test and Train (recommended 75:25 split)
Step - 6: Build KNN Algorithm from scratch and do the predictions for test data. You should not use the sklearn KNN algorithm here. Write the complete code implementation on KNN.
Step - 7: Evaluate your model
Step - 8: Train a model using sklearn KNN Algorithm and compare the results with your scratch implementation.
